# User Guide

To run the Jurnal application once you have cloned the project, node.js and npm need to be installed on the machine. Then using the terminal or command prompt perform the following from the root of the app directory:

1. Install dependencies: Using the terminal, navigate to the root of the application and run the command `npm install`.
2. Run the application: To run the server and client together use the `npm start` command within the terminal in the root directory.
   - To start only the client: `cd client` to navigate to the client directory and then use `npm start`. The client will start.
   - To start only the server: `cd server` to navigate to the server directory and then use `nodemon index.js`. The server will start.
3. Open the application: Open a web browser and enter the URL `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will be displayed.
